When he was 16 years old, he ran away from home and went to work in Detroit. From 1891 to 1899, he served as a mechanical engineer, later chief engineer at the Edison Electric Company. In 1893, he designed his first car in his spare time. From 1899 to 1902 he was a co-owner of the Detroit Automobile Company, but due to disagreements with the other owners of the company, he left it and in 1903 founded his company - the Ford Motor Company, which originally produced cars under the Ford A brand.</p>

Henry Ford died at the age of 83 at his home in Dirborne on April 7, 1947. With his death, a whole era in the history of Ford Motor ended, which, despite the death of its founder, continues to actively grow and develop.</p>
